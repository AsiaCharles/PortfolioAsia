        <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                I was born in San Juan City and grew up in a small but happy environment.<sup>1</sup>
                When I was a kid, sobrang hilig ko sa basketball dati, kaya lagi akong excited pag may time para gawin iyon.<sup>2</sup>
                My family was always supportive, kahit minsan makulit ako at mababa grades ko.<sup>3</sup>
                I remember spending most of my days playing with my friends sa kalsada or sa bakuran.<sup>4</sup>
                Madalas kaming maglaro ng basketball sa bakuran namin since may rim naman nakasabit doon at doon kami naglalaro, at doon nagsimula yung mga physical activities na ginagawa ko.<sup>5</sup>
                My childhood was filled with moments na sobrang simple pero sobrang saya.<sup>6</sup>
                I also learned basic responsibilities dahil tinuturuan ako ng parents ko.<sup>7</sup>
                Minsan stubborn ako, pero natuto rin ako unti-unti.<sup>8</sup>
                School days were fun kahit may mga times na tinatamad ako gumising.<sup>9</sup>
                I had teachers who inspired me in different ways, kahit pinapaiyak ako.<sup>10</sup>
                I enjoyed learning new things kahit minsan nakakabaliw yung assignments.<sup>11</sup>
                Mahilig din akong makipagkulitan sa mga classmates ko.<sup>12</sup>
                Every birthday celebration ko noon simple lang pero memorable.<sup>13</sup>
                I grew up playing mostly on the computer like FPS games or other games trending that time.<sup>14</sup>
                Tinuturuan ako ng mga kuya sa FPS games kaya may experience ako sa teenage life ko.<sup>15</sup>
                Nakakatakot maging bata minsan pero exciting din.<sup>16</sup>
                Marami akong natutunan sa mga maliit na experiences ko.<sup>17</sup>
                Those childhood moments helped shape who I am today.<sup>18</sup>
                Kahit hindi perfect ang childhood ko, sobrang thankful ako sa lahat ng memories.<sup>19</sup>
                Overall, my childhood was a mix of fun, lessons, and discoveries that I’ll never forget.<sup>20</sup>

        <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                My teenage years were a roller coaster, as in minsan chill, minsan chaotic.<sup>1</sup>
                Entering high school felt like starting a new chapter.<sup>2</sup>
                I met new friends who made those years unforgettable.<sup>3</sup>
                Dito ko rin na-experience yung unang stress sa academics.<sup>4</sup>
                Pero syempre, kasama rin yung mga kalokohan with friends.<sup>5</sup>
                I became more curious about the world and about myself.<sup>6</sup>
                Nag-start na rin yung pressure sa studies and expectations.<sup>7</sup>
                Sometimes I felt lost, pero normal naman daw yun sabi nila.<sup>8</sup>
                I also discovered new hobbies like gala sa iba't ibang places during my teenage years.<sup>9</sup>
                This was also the time that I started exploring my dreams seriously.<sup>10</sup>
                Nagkaroon ako ng mga insecurities tulad ng ibang teenagers.<sup>11</sup>
                Pero natuto rin akong i-accept yung sarili ko little by little.<sup>12</sup>
                Then the pandemic happened, and everything suddenly changed.<sup>13</sup>
                Bigla kaming nag-shift to online classes, at sobrang hirap mag-adjust sa setup.<sup>14</sup>
                Nakaka-miss ang friends dahil hindi kami makalabas at magkita.<sup>15</sup>
                Pero dahil sa pandemic, natuto akong maging mas patient at mas independent sa pag-aaral.<sup>16</sup>
                The situation was scary, pero tinuruan ako nito na maging grateful sa small things.<sup>17</sup>
                It also made me realize how important family and health really are.<sup>18</sup>
                Looking back, ang daming lessons that prepared me for the future.<sup>19</sup>
                Those teenage experiences, including the pandemic, helped me understand who I want to become.<sup>20</sup>

        <h2>College Years</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                My college journey started with a mix of excitement and kaba.<sup>1</sup>
                On my first day, hindi ko alam kung saan ako pupunta, pero nag-pretend akong confident.<sup>2</sup>
                College life felt different kasi mas independent na ako.<sup>3</sup>
                I met new classmates who eventually became close friends.<sup>4</sup>
                Dito ko naramdaman yung tunay na "adulting" moments.<sup>5</sup>
                The workload got heavier, but I learned how to handle it.<sup>6</sup>
                Marami ring group projects na minsan nakaka-stress pero nakaka-enjoy.<sup>7</sup>
                I discovered more about my strengths and weaknesses.<sup>8</sup>
                My professors challenged me to improve and grow.<sup>9</sup>
                Sometimes I felt overwhelmed, pero tinutulungan ako ng friends ko.<sup>10</sup>
                I also joined activities and organizations that helped me build confidence.<sup>11</sup>
                College taught me how to balance fun and responsibilities.<sup>12</sup>
                Nakakapagod pero fulfilling lalo na pag may na-achieve ako.<sup>13</sup>
                I gained experiences that I know will help me sa future job ko.<sup>14</sup>
                There were days na gusto ko nang sumuko, pero laban lang talaga.<sup>15</sup>
                Every semester felt like a new adventure na may ups and downs.<sup>16</sup>
                I learned how to manage my time better through deadlines and schedules.<sup>17</sup>
                College life made me stronger and more independent.<sup>18</sup>
                It helped me discover my path at kung ano talaga gusto ko sa buhay.<sup>19</sup>
                Overall, college shaped me into a more mature and determined person.<sup>20</sup>
